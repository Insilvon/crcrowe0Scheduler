To run this program:
1.) Take the crcrowe0Scheduler.jar file and run it. Pass in an argument for the quantum time you want.
  Ex: <java -jar crcrowe0Scheduler.jar 5> will run the scheduler with a quantum of 5. If no argument is specified,
  a default value of 3 will be assumed.
2.) When the program begins, it will ask for an input file. Input files should be located in the same directory as the jar file.
3.) Enter the name of the input file (not the directory) and press enter.
